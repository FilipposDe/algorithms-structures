To achieve sorting in one iteration, every element is checked for value, and swapped accordingly. 0s are positioned at the beginning, 2s at the end, and remaining numbers are 1s.

For the single iteration, time complexity is O(n) for n elements in the array and space complexity O(1) because the same number of variables are used independent of n.
